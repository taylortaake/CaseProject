					<h2>Before we talk about the parts...</h2>

					<p>
						It's important to understand that a computer is just a patchwork of unique and equally important parts,
						just as we as people are just a sum of unique and (mostly) equally important organs and processes. A computer 
						can't "think" without a brain (CPU), just as I can't communicate with it's different part without it's central 
						nervous system (motherboard). In the end, a computer is what results when you put all of these parts together
						to complete tasks that none of the parts could accomplish on their own.

				<div class="parts">
					<h2>The Body: Towers</h2>
					
					<p>
            A computers tower, also known as a case or chasis, is the frame that holds and protects its delicate parts
            from outside forces, much like our skin protects our body. It can be big, small, fat, skinny, any color
            under the rainbow, a box, a rectangle, a cube, a pyramid, or really anything a case company thinks they can
            sell you. There's always a perfect case for whatever combination of parts you want, and it's important to 
            make sure that you find a case that can adequeately support your exact computer.

          <h2>The Brain: Central Processing Units (CPU)</h2>

          <p>
            There are quite a few parts in a computer, and there needs to be something to direct and process all of the
            work and information that the computer is dealing with. The CPU does exactly that, and it's for that reason
            that, in many ways, your computer can only ever be as powerful as your CPU allows it to be. 
          </p>

				<div class="parts">
          <h2>The Eyes: Graphical Processing Units (GPU)</h2>

          <p>
            While, for now, computers aren't able to recreate the senses of touch, taste, or smell, they've come a long
            way in how they can stimulate our sight and hearing. The GPU, if your computer has one, takes responsibility
            for the former. While some CPUs can take this on themselves, it's always far more effective to have a GPU
            dedicated to the task. Some cases and motherboards allow for up to four or more GPUs in a computer, if you 
            can afford it. 
          </p>

				<div class="parts">
          <h2>The Long Term Memory: Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Drives (HDDs and SSDs)</h2>

          <p>
            It can be hard to make progress when you can't remember anything that happened the day before. In the case
            of computers, it'd be hard to operate for more than a second without an HDD or SSD to store the information.
            Functionally, HDDs and SSDs are the same. They store your data! An HDD is akin to an analog clock while an
            SSD is more like a digital clock. Computers tend to go so fast that the mechanical components of HDDs can
            bottleneck their performance, so SDDs are generally faster and more reliable.
          </p>

				<div class="parts">
          <h2>The Short Term Memory: Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>

          <p>
            Imagine trying to solve a math problem where you forget the equation that you're working with every time 
            you write down a number or letter. As you can probably guess, it'd take an absurd amount of time to get
            anything done. That's where RAM comes in. The more a task demands of a computer, the more RAM it may 
            need to keep track of everything.
          </p>

          <h2>The Mitochondria: Power Supply</h2>

          <p>
            While electricity is the fuel that powers the computer, the power supply is the regulator that makes it
            usuable for the rest of the computer. Power supplies are responsible for making sure that the energy that
            you put in isn't wasted, and depending on the needs of your computer, you may need one capable of handling
            larger amounts of energy. 
          </p>
				</div>

				<div class="parts">
          <h2>The Nervous System: Motherboard</h2>

          <p>
            A CPU can't access the memory in the RAM or HDD/SSD without the motherboard allowing them to communicate, 
            just like all the work that the GPU does is meaningless if it doesn't have a monitor to share it with, and
            none of the parts can do anything at all without the motherboard distributing the energy filtered by the 
            power supply. Motherboards are the parts that allow a computer to be more than just a bunch of parts. They 
            bring the computer to life by stitching it all together.
